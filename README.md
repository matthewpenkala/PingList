##INSTALLATION & USAGE

1.) Clone repo:

**`git clone https://github.com/matthewpenkala/PingList.git` for Python3**

*~~Original git repository https://github.com/brichbourg/PingList.git Python2 using socket library~~*

2.) Edit ips.txt to populate with your list of random IP addresses you want to test.

3.) Run script

   `sudo python3 pinglist.py ips.txt`

## Notes

This script uses a variation of the Python Ping script (http://www.g-loaded.eu/2009/10/30/python-ping/). This code is included in this repo and is imported by PingList.py. The use of this script requires running PingList.py as root, hence the reason to run with sudo.

## Python3

Python 3 is much more simplified and all pureping.py file is removed as the project no longer requires socket. I have tested it on UNIX/MAC and it should also work fine on Linux systems.

## Notification

Simply create a cronjob like the example below:

```python
0 */3 * * * /usr/bin/python3 <FULL PATH>/PingList/pinglist.py ips.txt
* * * * * /usr/bin/python3 <FULL PATH>/PingList/pinglist.py "<FULL PATH>/PingList/ips.txt" > /tmp/out.txt >> /tmp/out.txt
```

above will run every 3 hours to check the available systems and if there is any issue you will get a notification on your notification baar.
Also among the IPS you can enter websites.
make sure your python file executable by using `chmod a+x pinglist.py`
in case if there is any issue, you can check your logs by typing `mail` in OSX terminal.
